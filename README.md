# E-commerce Search & Product Recommendation with High-Value Customer Analysis

## Project Overview

-   Implemented recommendation modules including search recommendation (product embeddings and retrieval), similar product recommendation (embedding similarity), co-purchase recommendation (filtering), recently viewed and related product ranking, category-based recommendation (preprocessing), and banner recommendation (multi-armed bandit).
-   Improved product search accuracy and discovery through embedding-based retrieval and ranking strategies.
-   Leveraged outputs from the recommendation system to analyze high-value customer behavior and create data-driven profiles.
-   Built classification models to predict upselling potential and incremental revenue contributions.
-   Applied association rule mining to identify product affinities and designed bundle promotion strategies.
-   Simulated business impact through scenario analysis to estimate revenue lift from targeted campaigns.

## Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms need to optimize both product discovery and revenue growth. While recommendation systems enhance engagement through personalized suggestions, they often ignore the heterogeneous purchasing behaviors of high-value customers. Traditional loyalty programs fail to capture heterogeneous behaviors among high-value customers, limiting upselling and cross-selling opportunities.
As a result, upselling and cross-selling opportunities are underutilized, limiting the platform’s ability to maximize sales.

## Project Idea

This project combines advanced product recommendation modules with customer analytics to improve both personalization and monetization.  
The system not only retrieves and ranks products effectively but also leverages recommendation insights to segment high-value customers, predict their upselling potential, and design targeted marketing strategies.

## System Overview (Pipeline)

1. **Data Exploration**

    - Analyze product catalogs, transaction logs, and customer purchase histories.

2. **Recommendation Modules**

    - Search recommendation (Product embeddings and retrieval)
    - Similar product recommendation (Embedding similarity)
    - Co-purchase recommendation (Filtering-based)
    - Recently viewed & related product ranking
    - Category-based recommendation (Preprocessing)
    - Banner recommendation (Multi-armed bandit)

3. **Customer Segmentation & Profiling**

    - Use clustering to segment high-value customers by purchase patterns.
    - Develop behavioral profiles to capture distinct shopping traits.

4. **Upselling Prediction**

    - Train classification models to predict customers’ upselling potential.
    - Estimate incremental revenue contribution from prioritized customer groups.

5. **Association Rule Mining**

    - Identify product affinities and co-purchase patterns.
    - Create bundle promotions to maximize cross-selling opportunities.

6. **Revenue Impact Simulation**
    - Validate strategies using scenario analysis.
    - Estimate incremental revenue lift from targeted campaigns.
